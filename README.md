# cobol-check-automation
Automating COBOL testing with [cobolcheck](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-check) and GitHub Actions.

This is the [COBOL Programming Course #4](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/cobol-programming-course/tree/master/COBOL%20Programming%20Course%20%234%20-%20Testing)
project, but it works, as described in the course. Fixed pathes in the scripts, mainframe_operations.sh should run on the mainframe, added missing files, and the workflow
YAML definition is complete (eg. installing Zowe).

Good luck!
